Welcome to HelpChain!

Your Stellar Testnet wallet has been successfully created and funded with 10,000 XLM using Friendbot.

Wallet Public Key: ${publicKey}

Note:
- This is a testnet XLM, meaning it's not real currency and has no actual monetary value.
- These tokens are for testing and development only.
- You can use them to try out transactions within the HelpChain platform.

You're now ready to explore blockchain-powered donations and financial transparency with HelpChain!

Thanks,
Team HelpChain`;
